Top-Notes is a simple note-storage application that also lets you add some extra detail to your notes, categorize them and score them based on how you value them. This all makes it easy for you to track which ideas you have found most useful in the long term.

The notes are stored in `~\Documents\top-notes\notes.db`

To create a shortcut in Windows:
1. Make sure its `Start in` field corresponds to your Top-Notes folder
2. Set the `Target` field to `C:\Windows\pyw.exe main.py`
